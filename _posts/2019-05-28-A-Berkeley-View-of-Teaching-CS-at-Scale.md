> Over the past decade, undergraduate Computer Science (CS) programs across the
> nation have experienced an explosive growth in enrollment as computational
> skills have proven increasingly important across many domains and in the
> workforce at large. Motivated by this unprecedented student demand, the CS
> program at the University of California, Berkeley has tripled the size of its
> graduating class in five years. The first two introductory courses for
> majors, each taught by one faculty instructor and several hundred student
> teachers, combine to serve nearly 2,900 students per term. This report
> presents three strategies that have enabled the effective teaching, delivery,
> and management of large-scale CS courses: (1) the development of autograder
> infrastructure and online platforms to provide instant feedback with minimal
> instructor intervention and deliver the course at scale; (2) the expansion of
> academic and social student support networks resulting from changes in
> teaching assistant responsibilities and the development of several near-peer
> mentoring communities; and (3) the expansion of undergraduate teacher
> preparation programs to meet the increased demand for qualified student
> teachers. These interventions have helped both introductory and advanced
> courses address capacity challenges and expand enrollments while receiving
> among the highest student evaluations of teaching in department history.
> Implications for inclusivity and diversity are discussed.

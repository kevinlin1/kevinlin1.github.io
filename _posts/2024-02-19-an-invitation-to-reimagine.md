title: An Invitation to Reimagine
excerpt: >-
  Empowering Students to Redesign Computing Problems and Artifactsâ€‹
---

This year, my invited talk series will argue how **we should teach students not only how to answer questions, but also what questions to ask**. This work will be presented to the UW CSE faculty, the broader UW faculty through the *2024 Teaching & Learning Symposium*, and as a lightning talk in the *3C Fellows Spotlight*. Contact me at <kevinl@cs.uw.edu> to arrange a talk.

> Many undergraduate computing courses teach concepts using simplified models that are carefully aligned with learning objectives. But these models often encode design assumptions in both problem definitions and resulting solutions. When we choose to leave assumptions unexamined, we also choose to teach that it is not disciplinary practice to question them in their future work. This not only has a societal cost given the outsize impact of computing technologies, but also a personal cost to students' capacity to identify and address issues they care about in their computing work. How can we empower students to redesign computing problems and artifacts?

> In this talk, I will share how I address design assumptions through an invitation to reimagine: a pedagogical technique to teaching and assessing by redesigning the simplified models presented throughout the class. Examples will be drawn from an advanced data structures course and an intermediate data programming course, but the technique is applicable across the computing curriculum. Student attitudes and expectations (to appear in SIGCSE TS 2024) as well as broader limitations of this approach as a method for empowering students may be discussed. The session will conclude with workshop time for participants to collaboratively find ways to integrate this approach across computing courses.

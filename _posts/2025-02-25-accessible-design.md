How might we teach accessibility across the computing curriculum? This short talk introduces **redesign** as a conceptual frame for accessible design pedagogies and explores its applications in two courses: (1) Data Structures and Algorithms and (2) Data Programming. We identify principles of accessible design pedagogies, briefly workshop differences between inclusive design pedagogies and accessible design pedagogies, engage students to practical accessibility skills.

#### Guerrilla Sections
Collaborate with other students and learn new material by attending guerrilla section every other week. Led by staff tutors, this is one of the best resources for learning in a really social environment.

#### Computer Science Mentors
As a student, join Berkeley's CS teaching community [Computer Science Mentors](http://csmentors.berkeley.edu/) to participate in small group tutoring sessions of 4-5 students.

### Efficient Algorithms for Studying

*Study early, study often, and stay on top of the material!*

1. Reinvest Facebook time responding to Piazza and starring interesting questions. Try to answer questions clearly and succinctly.
2. Attend lab, discussion, and especially **guerrilla sections**. Guerrilla sections are by far the most useful resource available.
3. Before you begin reviewing material, complete 1 past exam in a timed environment to evaluate your skills. Identify what's working for you and what's not.
4. Practice. Review. Focus on guerrilla section, quizzes, homework, discussion, lab, and then lecture in this specific order. Seek help if an idea isn't setting in especially if it's a conceptual. Recursion isn't easy and the exam environment certainly doesn't make it any better! Ask your TA: we're always here to help!
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you feel comfortable with the exam.

#### Past Exams
- An exhaustive list is available on [Andrew Huang's course wiki](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~shidi/cs61a/wiki/Past_exams).
- [Alvin Wan's resource site](http://alvinwan.com/cs61a/) features several practice midterms
- Beware that major changes were made to the final third of the course over Fall 2014 and Fall 2015; older finals might not reflect current course content.

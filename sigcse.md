I'm presenting a paper, open educational resource, panel, and poster at SIGCSE TS 2022 focusing around **justice-centered approaches to CS in higher education**. Several authors from the University of Washington are thinking about starting a community of practice: to receive more information in the coming weeks, add the [**Paper Session: Ethics: Proposals and Counternarratives**](https://sigcse2022.us2.pathable.com/meetings/virtual/67bWzJXJQM89raQuM) to your agenda.

- [CS Education for the Socially-Just Worlds We Need]({% link _posts/2021-10-11-cs-education-for-the-socially-just-worlds-we-need.md %})
- EngageCSEdu: [Decision Trees for Text Classification in CS2]({% link text-classifier.md %})
- Approaches for Weaving Responsible Computing into Data Structures and Algorithms Courses

My prior work at RESPECT 2021 proposed [**affordance analysis**]({% link _posts/2021-01-05-do-abstractions-have-politics.md %}) as a more critical algorithm analysis centering the limitations, implications, and unjust outcomes when we apply data structures and algorithms to "solve" problems. This work presents the broader context and end purposes for engaging critical perspectives in our university classrooms by engaging questions like, "What do we ultimately want students to take away from our CS education?" See the [CSE 373 Winter 2022](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse373/22wi/) course website and [course project on GitHub](https://github.com/kevinlin1/huskymaps).

1. [**Autocomplete**](https://github.com/kevinlin1/huskymaps/wiki/Autocomplete) data structures and algorithms for *search suggestions* and *DNA indexing*.
1. [**Priority queue**](https://github.com/kevinlin1/huskymaps/wiki/Priority-Queues) data structures for *content moderation* and *shortest paths*.
1. [**Shortest paths**](https://github.com/kevinlin1/huskymaps/wiki/Shortest-Paths) and graph data structures for *seam carving* and *navigation directions*.

Justice-centered approaches to CS education emphasize 3 features: the content of curriculum (centering ethics), the design of learning environments (centering identity), and the politics and purposes of CS education reform.[^1] We should consider not only ethics, but also identity and political vision in our work.

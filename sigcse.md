I'm co-presenting a panel with Dan Garcia, Maria Camarena, and Jill Westerland at SIGCSE TS 2023: [**Equitable Grading Best Practices**](https://sigcse2023.sigcse.org/details/sigcse-ts-2023-panels/5/Equitable-Grading-Best-Practices). I'm also the Birds of a Feather Junior Co-Chair, so you can expect to see me zipping between rooms Thursday night to ensure we have a high-quality experience this year and in the future.

I'm always excited to chat about ways to design more identity-inclusive computing education that empowers undergraduate students to discover their own meanings for how they can use computing to help the world.

Hi, I'm Kevin.

I spend too much time designing websites (and, formerly, back-end) for [Berkeley Diversity](http://diversity.berkeley.edu). I love teaching the [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://cs61a.org) and [Data Structures](http://cs61b.ug). I'm really proud to join the teaching community at Berkeley this semester as an Undergraduate Student Instructor for [CS 61BL, Data Structures and Programming Methodology](http://cs61bl.org).

In my spare time, I also study [Computer Science](http://eecs.berkeley.edu/csugrad/) and [Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.berkeley.edu/).

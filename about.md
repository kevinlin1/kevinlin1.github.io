Hi, I'm Kevin.

I spend too much time designing websites for [Berkeley Diversity](http://diversity.berkeley.edu).

But my real passion is teaching. This semester, I'm really proud to join the course staff for [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://cs61a.org) as an Undergraduate Student Instructor. Next semester, I hope to return to my alma mater, [Data Structures](http://datastructur.es), before teaching [Great Ideas in Computer Architecture](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c) over the summer and completing the trifecta.

In my spare time, I also study [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/cs) and [Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. Studying is, admittedly, not as fun as teaching.

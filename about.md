Hi, I'm Kevin.

I spend too much time designing websites (and, formerly, back-end) for [Berkeley Diversity](http://diversity.berkeley.edu).

My real passion, though, is teaching. This semester, I'm really proud to join the teaching community at UC Berkeley as an Undergraduate Student Instructor for [CS 61BL](http://cs61bl.org). But I'm usually torn between teaching the [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://cs61a.org) and [Data Structures](http://cs61b.ug).

In my spare time, I also study [Computer Science](http://eecs.berkeley.edu/csugrad/) and [Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley.

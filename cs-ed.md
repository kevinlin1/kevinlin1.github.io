Check out the Allen School [Computer Science Education](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/current-students/career/cs-teaching) resource hub that describes how students can get involved in the school's educational efforts.

Are you a current or prospective **UW undergrad or CSE BS/MS student**?

Teaching
: Take [CSE 492T: Equitable and Inclusive Computer Science Pedagogy](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse492t/)!
: To teach CSE 12X with me, complete a [CSE 12X TA Application](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/ta/).
: To teach any other CSE course with me, complete a [CSE TA Application](https://ta.cs.washington.edu/apply/) and address the following points in your personal statement. It doesn't need to be particularly long. I'm interested in getting to know what you value as a teacher.
  - Describe what you think is the most important role of a teaching assistant.
  - Analyze a school experience you found particularly effective or ineffective.

Research
: Take [CSE 590E: Computer Science Education Seminar](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse590e/)!
: To pursue independent research with me, read more about [Undergraduate Research](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/enrichment/research) in the Allen School. Then, tell me what you're interested in working on.

Are you a current or prospective **PhD student**? I do not formally advise Ph.D students, but there are plenty of other researchers in [ComputingEd@UW](https://computinged.uw.edu/) who'd love to get to know you. Amy Ko has published an overview of [Computing Education Research](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/cer) at UW and beyond.
